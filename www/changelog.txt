Problems:
2. multiple touches won't register.  perhaps change event away from click.
    maybe use touchstart or mouseon.
3. figure out package.json, npm, and folder structure setup better.

Currently working on v0.3

** mobile testing CLI notes *********************
cordova run android --device

***** Plans *******

Testing v. 0.0.0
game screen
-colored regions, occupying 50% of screen.
-click increments score.
-model and controller score control only.

-On the game over screen:
--Sad message
--score

v 0.1.0
game over screen
-display score
-play again button

v 0.1.1
crab logic
-start with interval-timed switches.
-alter to randomize.

v 0.2
-add view
-show score

v 0.2.1
-refactor event listener code, so that the listeners remain on the two divs.
Instead of moving them each flip, the listeners just fire all the time,
and the handler decides what to do, based on whether the target div is 
crabHere or not.

v 0.3.0
make something with inkscape--anything--and try to get it into the app as SVG.

v 0.3.1
-add crab image
--next step: put into HTML
-work on orientation issues and positioning.  Will it work in both orientations of the phone?

v 0.3.2
-really not fun with predictable changeups.  Need to randomize timing.

v 0.3.2.1
-cross-browser testing.  if I wait until app is out, I may run into serious problems.

rn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Introduction

v 0.3.3
-animate crab.
--check out https://vimeo.com/373163932
    7.20.2020: eslint not respecting on-save setting, or ignore settings.

--multicolor stars?  tried and didn't like.  removed.  (committed with multicolor, to make rewind available).
--teleport effect:
    option 1: crab scurries between regions.  
        no more divs.  uniform background.  listen for clicks on svg hitbox.
        1. Put one crab on screen.  Restructure divs.
        2. Make crab translate between regions.  Test on both orientations.
        ** 7.29.2020 working on step 3.
        ** mouse/touchpad/mobile-touch issues.

---------------------------- touch event  issues ---------------------------------------

Solutions:

ok - desktop browser with mouse: mousedown.
ok - mobile browser: touchstart  (need clientX clientY fix for star location)
ok - mobile webview: touchstart
pc desktop touchpad: not distinguishable from fast mouse movement.  Touchpad indistinguishable from mouse, as well.  Leave out support.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------- sizing issue ------------------------------------------------------------
        ** Crab sizing needs fixing.  Positioning on some browsers.
            svg: width and height = 100%
            hitbox: width and height = 100%
            this should kinda solve it.  If I want the hitbox to be tight, then I see two, difficult options.
            Option 1: Use media queries that correlate screen sizes to the aspect ratio of the crab.
                Scale the crab according to height for one scenario, and width for the other.
            Option 2: Try putting a new master <g> inside of the <svg>.  Maybe the event listener could
                be attached to this.  Will it size smaller than the <svg>?
        *** next step 8.2.2020: browser testing.  Option 2 solution worked!  Also make sure positioning is ok.
------------- end sizing issue -----------------------------------------------------------

        3. Animate legs
        4. Make whole crab translation herky-jerky, like a real crab?
        5. Add single leg twitch before each move.
    option 2: crab drops into hole and pops out.

    to animate change, use css transitions?
    Maybe make the crab drop into a hole that opens up.

--spinny eyes?
--mouse-tracking eyes?  Check out https://creepyface.io/
--blinking?

v 0.3.4
-add background.

v 0.4
-sound, with accessibility in mind.
-animated background?

v 0.5
-remove game over.  Change to some sort of penalty, with visual and audible feedback.
-add clicks per second logic and view.

v 0.6
-monetize

v 0.7
-device state change testing.

v 1.0
-lock down for production.  Is this the MCV product?
--security
--lint all js.
--minifying or packaging for browser?  optimize svg (svgomg or svgo)
--see readme.md and index.html comments.

v 1.1
-publish to web
    cross browser testing.  See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Introduction
    scalability - how do I ensure service level?

v 1.1
-full accessibility
    keyboard playability on web
    really dig into blind user experience.  Can it be played independently from the beginning?

v 1.?
-difficulty settings.  Use crabswap parameters to set things.
    also consider changing animation and sound timings to be tighter or looser.

v 2.0?
-social
--leaderboard?  (firebase?)
--NFC contest?
