1. Dig through src and dist folders under phonegap-old.  Compare files and find most recent copy of code.
2. Create template for android app.
3. Move code into that template structure.  (No src and dist for android app?  What about for browser?  Do I need to do any minifying or packaging?).
4. Change JS code structure: don't add and remove event listeners any more.  Just have events fire on both active and inactive divs.  Use a flag variable to identify which one is active and direct to the appropriate event handler based on that.  Also: did I make it so that the divs actually move in the DOM tree?  Preferrable would be to leave the DOM tree alone and change the look of the divs.
